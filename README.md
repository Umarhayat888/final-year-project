1.	 Problem  Statement

In the previously designed control system, a wired technology was used, then with the popularity of the gsm, such systems were developed that could be controlled by using text messages.  A major drawback of using the text messages as control signals was that, they couldn't achieve the perfect targeting. 

2.	Aims & objectives

The main objective of this project is to design a wireless remote control system for the machine Gun using 3G technology and to minimize the soldier losses during War. By using this project they would be able to control the machine from a safe distance with visual monitoring. 

The Block Diagram of our proposed system is:

4.1	Theoratical approach

In this project a machine Gun will be mounted on a mechanical platform. This platform will consists of dc gear motor interfaced to the micro controller with the help of an H- bridge. 
the micro controller will  also be attached to the cell phone through the specially designed circuit for decoding the frequencies of the buttons pressed on the remote cell phone.
different buttons will be assigned to perform different tasks in real time. for example the clockwise and anti-clockwise rotation, the firing etc.

4.2	Analysis
A unique thing about our proposed project is that, it can be controlled through simple GSM and also with 2G and 3G. because in this project we will be taking advantage of the DTMF. as every button on a cell phone has its own frequency. so we will design such circuit that would be able to decode those frequencies and then using those frequency to control the Machine Gun in real time. by using DTMF we would be able to control the machine during call.


 
4.3	Result Expected
We will design such circuit that would be able to decode those frequencies and then using those frequency to control the Machine Gun in real time. by using DTMF we would be able to control the machine during call.


5.	Utilization of Project Research 


This project can have a worldwide fame because of its unique feature and that is the soldiers losses can be pretty much controlled. So this project can be practically adopted for the military purposes.
